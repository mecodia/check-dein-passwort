            <h1>10 Questions - 10 Answers</h1>

            <h3>1. Does this site save the passwords I enter?</h3>
            <p>No, we do not save any passwords. In fact, we are technically not even able to view them.</p>

            <h3>2. Where are the calculations for passwords done?</h3>
            <p>Your passwort is processed on your computer. This means that the password you does not leave your device and can not be accessed or viewed by us.</p>

            <h3>3. Is any other data about me saved? Werden sonstige Daten von mir gespeichert?</h3>
            <p>No, we do not save any personal data about you.</p>

            <h3>4. How is my password calculated  ?</h3>
            <p>Our algorithm simulates a brute force attack and thus comes up with an estimated time to successfully conduct such an attack. In doing so, the algorithm tries to match the password you entered with outside sources, such as lists of common passwords or names. The algorithm is open-source and you can view it and give feedback and ideas for further development on <a href="https://github.com/mecodia/check-dein-passwort" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

            <h3>5. How accurate is the result of the calculation?</h3>
            <p>The algorithm creates a rough estimate that can give you orientation and a better understanding of your passwords security. However, there are many different ways a brute-force attack can be executed and therefore it might be possible that a skilled hacker can break your password faster than estimated. We do not guarantee the correctness and validity of the results.</p>

            <h3>6. Where do I find additional information on how to set a secure password?</h3>
            <p>We encourage you to google for some advice about this. For example the following <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-create-a-strong-password-1797681069" target="_blank">article at lifehacker</a> has a great overview of tips and techniques for using secure passwords.</p>

            <h3>7. Is this site used to generate profit?</h3>
